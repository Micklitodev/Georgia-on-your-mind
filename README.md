# Georgia-on-your-mind

## Description:

Georgia state park patrons need a central location where they can leave reviews about previous experiences and read reviews from other like-minded outdoor enthusiasts and state park rangers as they plan future trips

The app will require park patrons to create a username and password after which they will have access to a central location for leaving and reading reviews on Georgia’s state parks.
